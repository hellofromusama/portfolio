                  Azad Kashmir is currently facing one of its most challenging humanitarian crises in recent history. What began as peaceful protests demanding basic rights has escalated into a situation of severe oppression, with the Pakistan government responding with brutal force that has resulted in deaths, injuries, and widespread fear among the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The people of Azad Kashmir are not asking for much‚Äîthey are simply demanding their fundamental human rights, economic justice, and the freedom to voice their concerns without fear of violence. Instead, they have been met with a heavy-handed crackdown that has left families grieving, communities traumatized, and an entire region in urgent need of support.
